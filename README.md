## Brief Overview
Using Object Oriented Programming (OOP) To Model Classification of Animal Phyllum
In the Categorization of the animal phyla, composition was favoured over inheritance, I followed the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, applied the 5 SOLID PRINCIPLES, and stayed within the corridor of Object Oriented Analysis and Design. I utilized the latest ES6 features like Destructuring, arrow functions, spread operator.
## Usage
- clone the repo and cd into the directory such that you are on `inheritance_vs_composition_demo`
- To run the solution, make sure you have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) installed
- use the following command terminal
```bash
# run animal.js
node animal.js

```
- You can change the inputs to see a different output

## Sample output
- If the `animal.js` is run as it is on this repository, the results look like
```bash
âžœ  inheritance_vs_composition_demo:$ node animal.js
